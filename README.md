*elfi* is a state container for JavaScript applications. It takes its roots in
libraries such as [Flux][flux] and [Redux][redux], but strives to remain simple
and avoid boilerplate code.

It only takes a few minutes to [learn][doc:guide], works great with
[Immutable.js][immutable] and [React][doc:react], and is easy to extend using
[middleware][doc:middleware].
